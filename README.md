This is often referred to as churn rate and is a key metric for practically all B2B and B2C businesses.

## Description on the project:
Customer churn is a challenge faced by all organizations. 
Customer churn is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. In the field of digital health care,
user churn prediction is important not only in terms of company revenue but also for improving the health of users. 
Here we have used the data collected from google and kaggl & then find how many customers are not using the product. 

## Customer churn
Customer churn is the percentage of customers who stopped purchasing your business's products or services during a certain period of time. 
Your customer churn rate indicates how many of your existing customers are not likely to make another purchase from your business.

#### 3 three parts of calculating customer churn
1) The number of customers.
2) The value of recurring business lost.
3) The percent of recurring value lost.
